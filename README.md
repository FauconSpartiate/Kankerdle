# Flutter-Wordle

A wordle game written by flutter

## How to play

Thanks to the feature of Fluttter, the game is available on all platforms

### Play on Web

### Deploy a web version

## What dictionary am I using

The hidden word is selected from one of the wordlists from [English wordlists for Chinese](https://github.com/mahavivo/english-wordlists)

The verification wordlist currently is an addup of all the wordlists available.

> Note that I'm changing the verification wordlist to [Letterpress wordlist](https://github.com/lorenbrichter/Words) lately.
